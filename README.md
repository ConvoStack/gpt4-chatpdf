# ConvoStack QuickStart Guide

Welcome to the ConvoStack Quickstart walkthrough! To follow along in our docs: https://docs.convostack.ai/getting-started/

In this repo's `index.ts` file, you will find three examples of connecting a Langchain OpenAI agent to the ConvoStack chatbot playground.

## Getting Started

Run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies.

To run an example agent, simply set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` in a `.env` file and run `npx ts-node src/index.ts` to generate a url to the ConvoStack chatbot playground.
